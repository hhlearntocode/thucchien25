trên cả nước.
The story should span 10 A4 pages, with 3-6 panels per page.
 The pacing must feel cinematic, emotionally progressive, and visually rhythmic, emphasizing visual storytelling, contrast, and transformation.

Narrative Structure
Act I — Setup
 Introduce the protagonist, their world, tone, and what is missing in their life.
 Establish a symbol or recurring visual motif that will reappear with new meaning in the final scene.
Act II — Catalyst
 Show the event that disrupts normal life.
 The protagonist faces a choice: act or ignore.
 Contrast emotion and tone sharply — light to dark, calm to chaos.
Act III — Rising Action
 The protagonist tries to fix things but fails.
 Introduce obstacles and tension — both internal and external.
 End each page with a mini cliffhanger to sustain momentum.
Act IV — Crisis
 Everything breaks. The protagonist faces loss, betrayal, or emotional collapse.
 Reveal that the true conflict is internal.
 Reintroduce the original symbol with new, deeper meaning.
Act V — Climax
 The protagonist makes a defining choice that demonstrates transformation.
 Depict this with large panels, minimal dialogue, and visual intensity.
Act VI — Resolution

 The character or world is transformed.
 End with a silent or symbolic moment that echoes the opening image.

Creative Principles
Center the narrative on emotional transformation, not exposition or worldbuilding.


Visual rhythm = emotional rhythm: pacing, lighting, and framing must reflect inner change.


Keep dialogue minimal but meaningful — each line should reveal emotion or theme.


Recontextualize the opening image in the ending to signal growth or realization.


Maintain universality: the same structure must adapt seamlessly to any genre — AI awakening, school life, mystery, fantasy, dystopia, psychological drama, etc.


Ensure each page feels visually distinct, progressing from light → dark → light again.

    A breathtaking scene where a majestic waterfall cascades down rugged cliffs, shimmering like silver threads under the warm sunlight. Lush greenery surrounds the falls—towering trees, vibrant flowers, and soft moss painting nature's perfect canvas. Mist rises gently, forming a magical rainbow that arches across the sky, while birds soar gracefully above as if dancing to the music of nature. A dreamlike moment that blends serenity and beauty in one stunning view.
